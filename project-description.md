# Test Project Outline – Module A – Static Website Design

## Competition time

3 hours

## Introduction

This project will focus on the creation of a static website using HTML and CSS only. You are asked to create a static website for a bicycle rental company called **VelOrda**.

For the promotion of cycling in the city, the company **VelOrda** has launched a project to create a safe and scalable online platform for managing bicycle rentals. Your development team has been tasked with building this service taking into account modern security and usability standards.

The website will consist of subpages which should be reachable under separate paths.

The website has to conform with accessibility standards (WCAG) and implement SEO best practices, as it will be used to attract new users for the bicycle rental service. Also, pay attention to Open Graph integration.

Responsiveness is also important and the website should look good on three different viewports: mobile, tablet, and desktop.

## General Description of Project and Tasks

The website must consist of four different pages which will be explained in detail in this section. The design of all subpages should be aligned.

Within the media files, the client provided some media, icons, and text. You are free to use them or create custom assets on your own.

As the website will be publicly available, it is important to the client that the website conforms to accessibility standards (WCAG) and implements SEO best practices.

The website must be responsive and support at least the following viewports:

- Mobile: 360x640
- Tablet: 768x1024
- Desktop: 1920x1080

No server-side or client-side framework is allowed for this project. Only HTML and CSS are allowed, and the code must pass W3C validation.

## Requirements

The goal of the website is to create an online platform for bicycle rentals. Potential customers must be able to inform themselves about the available bicycles, pricing plans, and frequently asked questions.

You need to create a website for the bicycle rental company. Define a color scheme suitable for the target audience. Pay attention to spacing and alignment.

Add different, relevant animations on each page.

You can add more information and elements to all pages as you see fit. It's also possible to add links that point towards pages that do not exist yet (for example to a login page).

For each page, some example text and more are provided in the media files. However, not all the provided material has to be used.

All required pages must be implemented. You may also add extra sections/pages if appropriate.

The following pages must be implemented.

### Home Page

A short but engaging landing page. The idea is to present the product using simple information and compelling media.

The page must include:

- A slider with a snap effect
- Clear information about the company
- A CTA (Call to Action) section
- Tabs for switching content

### Bicycle Page

This page should display bicycle specifications, including:

- Model
- Description
- Image
- Rating (max 5)

Show at least 5 bicycles.

### Pricing Page

Each bicycle has a price per minute. Create **3 pricing plans** and display them on this page.

### FAQ

Include questions with expandable answers (**pure CSS**).

At least 5 questions with answers must be shown.

### Global Elements

The following elements must be available on all pages:

- **Header**: must include at least the website name as text or a logo
- **Navigation**: with easily accessible links to all pages
- **Footer**: with at least a copyright notice

All elements may be enhanced with additional details where appropriate.

## Assessment

The project will be assessed using Google Chrome and Firefox.

Module A will be tested in the latest versions of Google Chrome and Firefox.

The axe browser extension in Google Chrome should be used to validate the website according to the accessibility standards WCAG.
